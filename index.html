       <p>My name is Olga Timbur. My passion for work comes from the desire for knowledge and the struggle my parents had to
          provide for me. Originally from Moldova, I had to emigrate when I was 20 years old for a better future like many of my
          people. I am happy to affirm that this experience taught me a lot about life and motivation</p>
       
       <p>In my work experience, I learned that I could achieve skills through hard work. Banking was one field I knew nothing
          about, but training and work made me gain skills such as customer service, sales, and teamwork skills. Following the
          line, I soon transitioned to the medical field, where multitasking, critical thinking, and productivity were significant
          components. This new experience made me realize that I can have a job in the tech field if I work hard. For many years,
          this was my goal, but my insecurities had to be destroyed.
        </p>
       
       <p> I am glad to say that today I am an emerging professional in the Application Development track in a program called <a href="https://www.yearup.org/">YearUp</a> and what are you reading right now is part 
           my traning to gain skills in the HTML and CSS languages</p>
       
      <p> I love spending time with friends, hiking, traveling, and enjoying a good movie or a good book. </p>
